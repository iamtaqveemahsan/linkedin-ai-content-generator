# linkedin-ai-content-generator
This n8n workflow automates LinkedIn content creation using a research-driven AI pipeline. It triggers on a schedule to pull post ideas from Google Sheets, performs real-time web research via Tavily, and uses a GPT-4o-mini agent to draft high-quality posts. Completed drafts are then automatically synced back to the sheet.
